Ansible by default uses python 


On the Ansible Server
ssh-keygen 
cat /home/ubuntu/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub

on the target server:

ssh-keygen
ls ~/.ssh/
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#paste the id_rsa.pub from Ansible Server

On Ansible Server
ssh (target_server)

Ansible Adhoc Commands:
inventory file #to keep the ip's of target servers
by default it saves in /etc/ansible/hosts

ansible -i inventory (target_server)
or
ansible -i inventory all

ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch task1"
# -m = module  -a = argument
